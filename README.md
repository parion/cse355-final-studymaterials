## Introduction
Materials in this repo are included for the sole purpose to study with in preparation for the ASU CSE 355 Final Exam for the Summer 2017 semester. I have no idea if these will be useful or helpful. I just want to do good on the final, man. 

There are six chapters from the book Introduction to the Theory of Computation (3<sup>rd</sup> Edition) that were covered in lecture and will be covered in the final exam. In this repo, each chapter is broken down into four sections:

* <b>Lectures:</b> Lectures are PDFs of Ryan Dougherty's notes for the Summer 2017 CSE 355 course. These notes should be considered the ASU gold standard and are the most important resource on this page. Along with the PDFs are Ryan's YouTube videos for each set of notes, some sectioned off by breaks, which he has graciously provided us.
* <b>Resources:</b> Resources are external sites or documents that cover the same topics in class. These external resources may teach concepts in different ways that may help you understand the material better. However, as they are taught differently, these resources' content must be taken with a grain of salt and you must make sure to refer to Ryan's lecture notes to make sure you understand the content as taught in class. Since TutorialsPoint and GeeksforGeeks cover virtually every topic in Theory of Computation, only the sections are listed. If a section is linked, ðŸ““ will be placed next to it.
* <b>Sample Problems:</b> Sample problems consist of problems that were found on external sites. All problem sets contain solutions along with the problems. However, even though these solutions may be mostly correct, their formatting or procedures may differ than what is actually expected on the exam.
* <b>Recap:</b> This section recaps concepts and topics you should be familiar with after reviewing each chapter. These concepts and topics many not all appear on the exam. Thanks to user Motunrayo on Piazza for the list of topics.

The problem sets and midterm solutions from the 355 class were purposely left out of this repository as their solutions will not be made public. However, it is recommended that you go back and check these documents out for yourselves and retry these problems yourselves for optimal studying.

If you wish to make a suggestion or contribute to the repository, please see [Contributing](#contributing).

## Other Resources
* [Introduction to the Theory of Computation Solutions](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1pmMQxkzlYfU0dzZ2trbWl4bmM/edit): <i>This is a PDF of the solutions to problems in the book. It's suggested that you go through the problem sets for each chapter in the book and attempt to work out solutions before looking at this PDF. This link may be broken in the future if the PDF is removed.</i>
* [Practice Problems for Final Exam](https://web.njit.edu/~marvin/cs341/oldexams/practice-final-soln.pdf): <i>These practice problems are <b>not</b> for the ASU CSE 355 courses. However, even though these are practice problems for a NJIT final exam, a review of these problems showed they are similar to ones we've seen in class and on previous exams. Friendly reminder to take their procedures and approaches to the problems with a grain of salt and always follow the procedures taught in class.</i>

## Recitations
There were four recitations over the course of the semester. You can find the PDFs of the worksheets to these recitations in the Recitations folder on the 355 page. These PDFs don't have the solutions to the problems and there's no known video source of the recitations.

However, Ryan Dougherty has a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhDf93xuCzIHRsAK-GpPt_dHJBNvFS7Bf) of all his recordings for his Spring 2017 CSE 355 recitations. Most videos will look identical to others since Ryan had multiple recitations every week.

## Previous Final Exam Review Session
For the Spring 2017 CSE 355 class, Ryan held a final exam review session during class. The video can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/B78ZPXRseIU). Do note that some of the content may have changed since.
