# CSE 355 Final Study Materials
Materials that might help studying for the CSE 355 Final Exam

## Introduction
Materials in this repo are included for the sole purpose to study with in preparation for the ASU CSE 355 Final Exam for the Summer 2017 semester. I have no idea if these will be useful or helpful. I just want to do good, man. 

All 355 notes were written by Ryan Dougherty as part of the Summer 2017 CSE 355 course. Sample problems were found on the web. Most, if not all, sample problems have solutions. Hopefully, they don't become dead links.

## Chapter 1: Regular Languages
The first chapter covers regular languages including topics like DFAs, NFAs, Product & Powerset Construction, Regular Expressions, Pumping Lemma, and Regular Grammar.
